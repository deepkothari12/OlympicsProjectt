They feature summer\\nand winter sports competitions in which thousands\\nof athletes from around the world participate in a\\nvariety of competitions. The Olympic Games are\\nconsidered the world's foremost sports competition,\\nwith more than 200 teams, representing sovereign\\nstates and territories, participating. By default, the\\nGames generally substitute for any world\\nchampionships during the year in which they take\\nplace (however, each class usually maintains its own\\nrecords).[2] The Olympics are staged every four\\nyears. Since 1994, they have alternated between the\\nSummer and Winter Olympics every two years\\nduring the four-year Olympiad.[3][4]\\nTheir creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic\\nGames, held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th\\ncentury BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de\\nCoubertin founded the International Olympic\\nCommittee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first\\nmodern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the\\ngoverning body of the Olympic Movement, which\\nencompasses all entities and individuals involved in\\nthe Olympic Games. The Olympic Charter defines their structure and authority.\\nThe evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in\\nnumerous changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the\\nWinter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with\\ndisabilities, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental Games (Pan\\nAmerican, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not\\ncontested in the Olympic Games. The IOC also endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics.\\nThe IOC need to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The\\nabuse of amateur rules prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by\\nCoubertin, to the acceptance of professional athletes participating at the Games. The growing\\nimportance of mass media has created the issue of corporate sponsorship and general\\ncommercialisation of the Games. World Wars I and II led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and\\n1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and\\n1984 Olympics;[5] and the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19\\nrestrictions.\\n3/6/25, 5:12 PM Olympic Games - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games#Amateurism_and_professionalism 1/48\"),\n",

As the decision-\\nmaking body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and\\nfunds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic\\nprogramme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic\\nrituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag, torch, and opening and closing ceremonies.

This growth has created numerous\\nchallenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, match fixing, bribery, and terrorism.\\nEvery two years, the Olympics and its media exposure provide athletes with the chance to attain\\nnational and international fame. The Games also provide an opportunity for the host city and\\ncountry to showcase themselves to the world.\\nThe Olympic Games have become a significant global event, fostering international cooperation\\nand cultural exchange.[6] At the same time, hosting the Olympic Games can also bring significant\\neconomic benefits and challenges to the host city, affecting infrastructure, tourism and local\\ncommunities.[7]\\nThe Ancient Olympic Games (Ancient Greek: τὰ Ὀ λύμπια, ta\\nOlympia[8]) were religious and athletic festivals held every four\\nyears at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece. The date of\\nthe festival was determined according to a complicated formula\\nwhereby the midpoint of the festival would occur during the\\nsecond full moon after the summer solstice—usually late\\nAugust or early September.[9]: p. 26 [10]: p. 38  This \"came after the\\nannual harvest but before the picking of the olives.\"[10] Heralds\\nwere sent from Elis to announce the dates.[9]: p. 26 [10]: p. 38 \\nCompetition at first was among only \"legitimate sons of free-born Greek parents.\"[10]: p. 49 \\nHowever, after Macedonia, and then Rome, conquered Greece, the ten Olympic judges loosened\\nthe earlier standard and permitted anyone who spoke Greek to participate.[10]: p. 50  Tens of\\nthousands of Greeks would make the difficult journey to attend the festival.[9]: p. 55  Some sources\\nsay as many as 40,000 attended.[11][12] These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat\\nsports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. It has been widely\\nwritten that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed\\nuntil the Games were finished. This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or\\ntruce.[13] This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce did\\nallow those religious pilgrims who were traveling to Olympia to pass through warring territories\\nunmolested because they were protected by Zeus.[14] See also Finley and Pleket.[9]: pp. 98–99 \\nThe origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend;[15]: p. 12  one of the most popular\\nmyths identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games.[15]: pp. 12–13 [16][17][18]\\nAccording to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games \"Olympic\" and established the\\nAncient Olympics\\n3/6/25, 5:12 PM Olympic Games - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games#Amateurism_and_professionalism 2/48'),\n",

Following its completion, he\\nwalked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a \"stadion\" (Ancient Greek: στάδιον,\\nLatin: stadium, \"stage\"), which later became a unit of distance. The most widely accepted inception\\ndate for the Ancient Olympics is 776 BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, listing the\\nwinners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776 BC.[2] For the first thirteen Olympics,\\nthe stadion footrace was the only event contested,[10]: p. 145 [19] and victory in that sprint was so\\nvalued that the next Olympiad was named after the winner, e.g. \"the third year of the eighteenth\\nOlympiad when Ladas of Argos won the stadion.\"[10]: p. 145  The Ancient Games varied over time,\\nbut they came to feature running events, a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, discus and\\njavelin throws, a foot race, and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, pankration, and equestrian\\nevents.[20][21] Tradition has it that Coroebus, a cook from the city of Elis, was the first Olympic\\nchampion,[22] which indicates that the competition was not limited to the aristocracy.[10]: pp. 50–51 \\nThe Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, and the sporting events, which were held\\nalongside ritual sacrifices honouring both Zeus (whose famous statue by Phidias stood in his\\ntemple at Olympia) and Pelops (divine hero and mythical king of Olympia), did not start until the\\nfestival\\'s second day.[9]: p. 15  (Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King Oenomaus of\\nPisatis.[23]) The winners of the events were admired and immortalised in poems and statues.[24]\\nAlthough a wreath made from the sacred olive tree in the precinct of Zeus was the only official\\nprize at the Olympic Games, winners\\' fame brought them economic wealth, too, in the form of\\nsubsidies from their hometowns and wealthy sponsors. See, e.g., Finley and Pleket,[9]: pp. 24, 76–82 \\nand Perrottet[10]: pp. 13–14  The Games were held every four years, and this period, known as an\\nOlympiad, was used by Greeks as one of their units of time measurement. The Games were part of\\na cycle known as the Panhellenic Games, which included the Pythian Games, the Nemean Games,\\nand the Isthmian Games.[25]\\nThe Olympic Games reached the height of their success in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, but then\\ngradually declined in importance as the Romans gained power and influence in Greece. While\\nthere is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held\\ndate is 393 AD, when the emperor Theodosius I decreed that all pagan cults and practices be\\neliminated.[b] Another date commonly cited is 426 AD, when his successor, Theodosius II, ordered\\nthe destruction of all Greek temples.[26]\\nVarious uses of the term \"Olympic\" to describe athletic events in the modern era have been\\ndocumented since the 17th century. The first such event was the Cotswold Games or \"Cotswold\\nOlimpick Games\", an annual meeting near Chipping Campden, England, involving various sports.\\nIt was first organised by the lawyer Robert Dover between 1612 and 1642, with several later\\ncelebrations leading up to the present day.

The Organizing Committee led by Peter\\nUeberroth used some of the profits to endow the LA84 Foundation to promote youth sports in\\nSouthern California, educate coaches and maintain a sports library. The 1984 Summer Olympics\\nare often considered until that date, the most financially successful modern Olympics and a model\\nfor future Games.[72]\\nBudget overruns are common for the Games. Average overrun for Games since 1960 is 156% in real\\nterms,[73] which means that actual costs turned out to be on average 2.56 times the budget that\\nwas estimated at the time of winning the bid to host the Games. Montreal 1976 had the highest cost\\noverrun for Summer Games, and for any Games, at 720%; Lake Placid 1980 had the highest cost\\noverrun for Winter Games, at 324%. London 2012 had a cost overrun of 76%, Sochi 2014 of\\n289%.[71]\\nIt has been documented that cost and cost overrun for the Games follow a power-law distribution,\\nwhich means that, first, the Games are prone to large cost overruns and, second, it is only a matter\\nof time until an overrun occurs that is larger than the largest to date. In short, hosting the Games is\\neconomically and financially extremely risky.[74]\\nThe final cost for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics was reported to be JPY 1,423.8 billion (US$13 billion).\\nThis was achieved by balancing revenues and expenditures through various efforts to increase\\nrevenue and continuously review expenditures. The primary sources of revenue included the\\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) contribution of JPY 86.8 billion (US$0.8 billion), TOP\\nsponsorship of JPY 56.9 billion (US$0.5 billion), local sponsorship of JPY 376.1 billion (US$3.4\\nbillion), an insurance payout of JPY 50 billion (US$0.5 billion) for the postponement of the\\nGames, and other sources including licensing. The expenditures included JPY 195.5 billion (US$1.8\\nbillion) for venue-related costs and JPY 444.9 billion (US$4 billion) for service expenditures. The\\ntotal cost also accounted for COVID-19 countermeasures amounting to JPY 35.3 billion (US$0.3\\nbillion). Despite initial estimates, the total costs were reduced by JPY 220.2 billion (US$2 billion)\\nfrom the budget announced in December 2020, and JPY 29.2 billion (US$0.3 billion) from the\\nestimated budget in December 2021. This successful financial management resulted in a balanced\\nbudget for the Tokyo 2020 Games.[75][76]\\nSeeking a scholarly institution to independently research the Games, Bob Barney led efforts to\\nestablish the International Centre for Olympic Studies in 1989, endeavouring to write about\\nsociocultural impacts of the Olympic Games.[77][78] He felt that the Olympics \"is worthy of study\\nbecause it is one of the biggest meetings in a global context and has many political, economic, and\\nother problems associated with it\".[77] He began Olympika in 1992, the first peer-reviewed\\nacademic journal focused on the Olympic Games.[79][80] The International Society of Olympic\\nHistorians was founded in 1991, which publishes the Journal of Olympic History.[81]\\nSome economists are sceptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games,\\nemphasising that such \"mega-events\" often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible\\nbenefits in the long run.[82] Hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the\\nhost country\\'s exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when\\nbidding to host the Games.[83] Research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a positive\\nEconomic and social impact on host cities and countries\\n3/6/25, 5:12 PM Olympic Games - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games#Amateurism_and_professionalism 8/48'),\n",

The Guardian stated that\\nthe biggest threat to the future of the Olympics is few cities or countries want to host them.[88]\\nBidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics became a two-city race between Paris and Los Angeles, so\\nthe IOC took the unusual step of simultaneously awarding both the 2024 Games to Paris and the\\n2028 Games to Los Angeles.

For example, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) is\\nthe IF for association football, and the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball is the\\ninternational governing body for volleyball. There are currently 35 IFs in the Olympic\\nMovement, representing each of the Olympic sports.[92]\\nNational Olympic Committees (NOCs) represent and regulate the Olympic Movement within\\neach country.

The presidential terms of Avery Brundage and Juan Antonio Samaranch were\\nespecially controversial. Brundage fought strongly for amateurism and against the\\ncommercialisation of the Olympic Games, even as these attitudes came to be seen as incongruous\\nwith the realities of modern sports. The advent of state-sponsored athletes from the Eastern Bloc\\ncountries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it placed self-financed amateurs of\\nWestern countries at a disadvantage.[97]: pp. 52–60  Brundage was accused of antisemitism and of\\nracism in resisting the exclusion of South Africa.[97]: pp. 60–69  Under the Samaranch presidency, the\\noffice was accused of both nepotism and corruption.[98] Samaranch\\'s ties with the Franco regime\\nin Spain were also a source of criticism.[99]\\nIn 1998, it was reported that several IOC members had taken gifts from members of the Salt Lake\\nCity bid committee for the hosting of the 2002 Winter Olympics. There were soon four\\nindependent investigations underway: by the IOC, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC),\\nthe Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC), and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ).\\nAlthough nothing strictly illegal had occurred, it was felt that the acceptance of the gifts was\\nmorally dubious. As a result of the investigation, ten members of the IOC were expelled and a\\nfurther ten sanctioned.[100] Stricter rules were adopted for future bids, and caps were introduced\\nto define how much IOC members could accept from bid cities. Additionally, new term and age\\nlimits were put into place for IOC membership, and fifteen former Olympic athletes were added to\\nthe committee. Nevertheless, from sporting and business standpoints, the 2002 Olympics were one\\nof the most successful Winter Games in history; records were set in both the broadcasting and\\nmarketing programs. Over 2 billion viewers watched more than 13 billion viewer-hours.[101] The\\n2002 Games were also a financial success, raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior\\nOlympic Games, leaving SLOC with a surplus of $40 million. This excess revenue was used to\\ncreate the Utah Athletic Foundation (also known as the Utah Olympic Legacy Foundation), which\\nmaintains and operates many of the surviving Olympic venues.[101]\\nIt was reported in 1999 that the Nagano Olympic bid committee had spent approximately\\n$14 million on entertaining the 62 IOC members and many of their associates. The precise figures\\nare unknown since Nagano destroyed the financial records after the IOC requested that the\\nentertainment expenditures should not be made public.[102][103]\\nIn July 2000, when the Los Angeles Times reported on the tangled nature of how the IOC\\nredistributes profits from sponsorships and broadcasting rights, Olympic historian Bob Barney\\nstated that he had \"yet to see matters of corruption in the IOC\", but noted there were \"matters of\\nunaccountability\".[104] He later noted that when the spotlight is on the athletes, it has \"the power\\nto eclipse impressions of scandal or corruption\", with respect to the Olympic bid process.[105]\\nAn August 2004, a BBC documentary, Panorama: Buying the Games, reported the results of an\\ninvestigation into bribes allegedly used in the bidding process for the 2012 Summer Olympics.[106]\\nThe documentary claimed that it was possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular\\ncandidate city.

For example,\\nwrestling is a Summer Olympic sport, comprising two disciplines: Greco-Roman and Freestyle. It\\nis further broken down into fourteen events for men and four events for women, each representing\\na different weight class.[166] The Summer Olympics programme includes 26 sports, while the\\nWinter Olympics programme features 15 sports.[167] Athletics, swimming, fencing, and artistic\\ngymnastics are the only summer sports that have never been absent from the Olympic programme.\\nCross-country skiing, figure skating, ice hockey, Nordic combined, ski jumping, and speed skating\\nhave been featured at every Winter Olympics programme since its inception in 1924. Current\\nOlympic sports, like badminton, basketball, and volleyball, first appeared on the programme as\\ndemonstration sports, and were later promoted to full Olympic sports. Some sports that were\\nfeatured in earlier Games were later dropped from the programme.[168]\\nOlympic sports are governed by international sports federations (IFs) recognised by the IOC as the\\nglobal supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC.[169] There are\\nsports recognised by the IOC that are not included in the Olympic programme. These sports are\\nnot considered Olympic sports, but they can be promoted to this status during a programme\\nrevision that occurs in the first IOC session following a celebration of the Olympic Games.[170][171]\\nDuring such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the programme on the basis of a two-\\nthirds majority vote of the members of the IOC.[172] There are recognised sports that have never\\nbeen on an Olympic programme in any capacity, for example, orienteering.[173]\\nIn October and November 2004, the IOC established an Olympic Programme Commission, which\\nwas tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic programme and all non-Olympic recognised\\nsports. The goal was to apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic programme for\\neach celebration of the Games.[174] The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a\\nsport should be included on the Olympic programme.[174] These criteria are history and tradition\\nof the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the\\nInternational Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport.[174] From this study\\nfive recognised sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf,\\nkarate, rugby sevens, roller sports and squash.[174] These sports were reviewed by the IOC\\nExecutive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five\\nsports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash.[174]\\nNeither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to\\nthe Olympic programme.[174] In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby sevens as\\nOlympic sports for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Games.[175]\\nThe 114th IOC Session, in 2002, limited the Summer Games programme to a maximum of 28\\nsports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes.[174] Three years later, at the 117th IOC Session, the first\\nmajor programme revision was performed, which resulted in the exclusion of baseball and softball\\nfrom the official programme of the 2012 London Games. Since there was no agreement in the\\npromotion of two other sports, the 2012 programme featured just 26 sports.[174] The 2016 and\\n2020 Games will return to the maximum of 28 sports given the addition of rugby and golf.[175]\\nSports\\n3/6/25, 5:12 PM Olympic Games - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games#Amateurism_and_professionalism 16/48\"),\n",

In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-\\nrounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a\\nprevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training\\nwas considered tantamount to cheating.[176] Those who\\npractised a sport professionally were considered to have an\\nunfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a\\nhobby.[176]\\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies\\nthroughout the history of the modern Olympics. The 1912\\nOlympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals when it was\\ndiscovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were\\nposthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 after a ruling found that the decision to strip him of his\\nmedals fell outside of the 30-day period.[177] Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the 1936 Winter\\nOlympics in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned\\nmoney with their sport and were thus considered professionals.[178]\\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries eroded\\nthe ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a\\ndisadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students,\\nsoldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a\\nfull-time basis.[176][179][180] The situation greatly disadvantaged American and Western European\\nathletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and\\n1980s.[181] As a result, the Olympics shifted away from amateurism, as envisioned by Pierre de\\nCoubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes,[182] but only in the 1990s, after the\\ncollapse of the Soviet Union and its influence within the International Olympic\\nCommittee.[183][184][185]\\nNear the end of the 1960s, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) felt their amateur\\nplayers could no longer be competitive against the Soviet team\\'s full-time athletes and the other\\nconstantly improving European teams. They pushed for the ability to use players from professional\\nleagues but met opposition from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and IOC. At the\\nIIHF Congress in 1969, the IIHF decided to allow Canada to use nine non-NHL professional\\nhockey players[186] at the 1970 World Championships in Montreal and Winnipeg, Canada.[187] The\\ndecision was reversed in January 1970 after Brundage said that ice hockey\\'s status as an Olympic\\nsport would be in jeopardy if the change was made.[186] In response, Canada withdrew from\\ninternational ice hockey competition and officials stated that they would not return until \"open\\ncompetition\" was instituted.[186][188] Günther Sabetzki became president of the IIHF in 1975 and\\nhelped to resolve the dispute with the CAHA. In 1976, the IIHF agreed to allow \"open competition\"\\nbetween all players in the World Championships. However, NHL players were still not allowed to\\nplay in the Olympics until 1988, because of the IOC\\'s amateur-only policy.[189]\\nAmateurism and professionalism\\nTeam Canada ice hockey dispute\\n3/6/25, 5:12 PM Olympic Games - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games#Amateurism_and_professionalism 17/48'),\n",

New\\nZealand was also one of the African boycott targets, because its\\nnational rugby union team had toured apartheid-ruled South\\nAfrica. The IOC conceded in the first two cases, but refused to\\nban New Zealand on the grounds that rugby was not an\\nOlympic sport.[192] Fulfilling their threat, twenty African\\ncountries were joined by Guyana and Iraq in a withdrawal from\\nthe Montreal Games, after a few of their athletes had already\\ncompeted.[192][193]\\nThe Republic of China (Taiwan) was excluded from the 1976\\nGames by order of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the prime minister of\\nCanada. Trudeau's action was widely condemned as having\\nbrought shame on Canada for having succumbed to political\\npressure to keep the Chinese delegation from competing under\\nits name.[194] The ROC refused a proposed compromise that\\nwould have still allowed them to use the ROC flag and anthem\\nas long as the name was changed.[195] Athletes from Taiwan did not participate again until 1984,\\nwhen they returned under the name of Chinese Taipei and with a special flag and anthem.[196]\\nIn 1980 and 1984, the Cold War opponents boycotted each other's Games.

When the Romanian athletes entered during the\\nopening ceremonies, they received a standing ovation from the\\nspectators, which comprised mostly U.S. citizens. The boycotting nations of the Eastern Bloc\\nstaged their own alternate event, the Friendship Games, in July and August.[198][199]\\nThere had been growing calls for boycotts of Chinese goods and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing in\\nprotest of China\\'s human rights record, and in response to Tibetan disturbances. Ultimately, no\\nnation supported a boycott.[200][201] In August 2008, the government of Georgia called for a\\nboycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics, set to be held in Sochi, Russia, in response to Russia\\'s\\nparticipation in the 2008 South Ossetia war.[202][203] Continuing human rights violations in China\\nhave led to \"diplomatic boycotts\", where athletes still compete at the Games but diplomats do not\\nattend, of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing by several countries, most notably the United\\nStates.[204][205]\\nThe Olympic Games have been used as a platform to promote\\npolitical ideologies almost from its inception. Nazi Germany\\nwished to portray the National Socialist Party as benevolent\\nand peace-loving when they hosted the 1936 Games, though\\nthey used the Games to display Aryan superiority.[29]: p. 107 \\nGermany was the most successful nation at the Games, which\\ndid much to support their allegations of Aryan supremacy, but\\nnotable victories by African American Jesse Owens, who won\\nfour gold medals, and Hungarian Jew Ibolya Csák, blunted the\\nmessage.[29]: pp. 111–112  The Soviet Union did not participate\\nuntil the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Instead, starting\\nin 1928, the Soviets organised an international sports event\\ncalled Spartakiads. During the interwar period of the 1920s and\\n1930s, communist and socialist organisations in several\\ncountries, including the United States, attempted to counter\\nwhat they called the \"bourgeois\" Olympics with the Workers\\nOlympics.[207][208] It was not until the 1956 Summer Games\\nthat the Soviets emerged as a sporting superpower and, in doing so, took full advantage of the\\npublicity that came with winning at the Olympics.[209] Soviet Union\\'s success might be attributed\\nto a heavy state\\'s investment in sports to fulfill its political agenda on an international\\nstage.[210][180]\\nIndividual athletes have also used the Olympic stage to promote their own political agenda. At the\\n1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, two American track and field athletes, Tommie Smith and\\nJohn Carlos, who finished first and third in the 200 metres, performed the Black Power salute on\\nthe victory stand.

He was officially\\ncleared of intentionally avoiding the bout, but his receipt of the prize money raised suspicion.[212]\\nIn 2022, in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the IOC Executive Board \"recommends no\\nparticipation of Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials, urges International Sports\\nFederations and organizers of sports events worldwide to do everything in their power to ensure\\nthat no athlete or sports official from Russia or Belarus be allowed to take part under the name of\\nRussia or Belarus.\"[213] In 2023, the IOC announced that Russian and Belarusian athletes could\\nparticipate in the Olympics under certain conditions: they must not represent their country or any\\nassociated organization, and those actively supporting the Russian invasion of Ukraine are barred\\nfrom competing. This decision aimed to allow athletes to compete and enhance their stature. While\\n32 athletes accepted the invitation, 28 qualified athletes declined. Competing under a neutral flag\\nand uniform, these athletes had a neutral song played if they won any medals, instead of their\\nnational anthems. Additionally, the audience was prohibited from waving their flags.[214]\\nIn the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs to improve their athletic\\nabilities.

A\\nDanish cyclist, Knud Enemark Jensen, fell from his bicycle and\\nlater died. A coroner\\'s inquiry found that he was under the\\ninfluence of amphetamines.[216] By the mid-1960s, sports\\nfederations started to ban the use of performance-enhancing\\ndrugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.[217]\\nAccording to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB\\ncolonel stated that the agency\\'s officers had posed as anti-\\ndoping authorities from the International Olympic Committee to undermine doping tests and that\\nSoviet athletes were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\".[218] On the topic of the 1980\\nSummer Olympics, a 1989 Australian study said \"There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow\\nGames, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually\\nseveral kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists\\' Games.\"[218]\\nIn 2016, documents obtained revealed the Soviet Union\\'s plans for a statewide doping system in\\ntrack and field in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the\\ncountry\\'s decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of\\nthe program, along with suggestions for further enhancements.[219] The communication, directed\\nto the Soviet Union\\'s head of track and field, was prepared by Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for\\nPhysical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of\\nthe Russian doping programme prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.[219]\\nThe first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance-enhancing drugs was Hans-\\nGunnar Liljenwall, a Swedish pentathlete at the 1968 Summer Olympics, who lost his bronze\\nmedal for alcohol use.[220] One of the most publicised doping-related disqualifications occurred\\nafter the 1988 Summer Olympics where Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson (who won the 100-metre\\ndash) tested positive for stanozolol.[221]\\nIn 1999, the IOC formed the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in an effort to systematise the\\nresearch and detection of performance-enhancing drugs. There was a sharp increase in positive\\ndrug tests at the 2000 Summer Olympics and 2002 Winter Olympics due to improved testing\\nconditions. Several medallists in weightlifting and cross-country skiing from post-Soviet states\\nwere disqualified because of doping offences. The IOC-established drug testing regimen (now\\nknown as the Olympic Standard) has set the worldwide benchmark that other sporting federations\\nattempt to emulate.[222] During the Beijing games, 3,667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the\\nauspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Both urine and blood tests were used to detect banned\\nsubstances.[216][223] In London over 6,000 Olympic and Paralympic athletes were tested. Prior to\\nthe Games 107 athletes tested positive for banned substances and were not allowed to\\ncompete.[224][225][226]\\nIn 2024, rumors about China\\'s doping spread as many of the athletes, especially in swimming,\\nwere accused of doping before Tokyo 2020. 23 Chinese swimmers were tested positive for\\nprohibited substances, with both the World Anti-Doping Agency and World Aquatics accepting\\nChinese claims that positive tests were caused by tainted food.[227] After the FBI and Justice\\nDepartment started investigating, the IOC threatened to revoke the 2034 Olympics in Salt Lake\\nCity, unless they dropped the investigation.[228]\\n3/6/25, 5:12 PM Olympic Games - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games#Amateurism_and_professionalism 21/48'),\n",

From 2011\\nto 2015, more than a thousand Russian competitors in various sports, including summer, winter,\\nand Paralympic sports, benefited from a cover-up.[229][230][231][232] Russia was partially banned\\nfrom the 2016 Summer Olympics and was banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics (while still\\nbeing allowed to participate as the \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\") due to the state-sponsored\\ndoping programme.[233][234]\\nIn December 2019, Russia was banned for four years from all major sporting events for systematic\\ndoping and lying to WADA.[235] The ban was issued by WADA on 9 December 2019, and the\\nRussian anti-doping agency RUSADA had 21 days to make an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for\\nSport (CAS). The ban meant that Russian athletes would only be allowed to compete under the\\nOlympic flag after passing anti-doping tests.[236] Russia appealed the decision to the CAS.[237] The\\nCAS, on review of Russia\\'s appeal of its case from WADA, ruled on 17 December 2020, to reduce\\nthe penalty that WADA had placed. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling\\nallowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of\\ntwo years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as\\n\"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display \"Russia\"\\non the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform\\'s design, although\\nthe name should be up to equal predominance as the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation.[238]\\nIn February 2022, during the Beijing Olympics, the international news media reported on 9\\nFebruary that the issue of doping was again raised over a positive test for trimetazidine by the\\nROC\\'s Kamila Valieva,[239][240] which was officially confirmed on 11 February.[241] Valieva\\'s\\nsample in question was taken by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) at the 2022 Russian\\nFigure Skating Championships on 25 December, but the sample was not analyzed at the World\\nAnti-Doping Agency (WADA) laboratory where it was sent for testing until 8 February, one day\\nafter the team event concluded.[242] The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) was expected to hear\\nthe case on 13 February with a decision scheduled for announcement on 14 February ahead of her\\nscheduled appearance in the women\\'s singles event beginning 15 February.[243][244] Due to Valieva\\nbeing a minor at the time, as well as being classified as a \"protected person\" under WADA\\nguidelines, RUSADA and the IOC announced on 12 February that they would broaden the scope of\\ntheir respective investigations to include members of her entourage (e.g. coaches, team doctors,\\netc.).[245] By the end of the Beijing Olympics, a total five athletes were reported for doping\\nviolations.[246] A decision by RUSADA was issued in mid-October, which was endorsed by WADA,\\nstating that the details of the Valieva hearing and its scheduled dates would be placed under\\ninternational guidelines for the protection of minors (Valieva was 15 years old when the positive\\ntest results were disclosed) and not to be disclosed publicly.[247] Although Russia as a country is\\ncurrently banned from participating in international skating events due to the 2022 Russian\\ninvasion of Ukraine, Valieva has continued to compete within Russian borders without being\\nhindered by RUSADA as recently as the Russian Grand Prix held in October 2022.[248] In mid-\\nNovember, WADA requested that CAS take up the review of the Valieva case with an eye towards a\\n4-year suspension of Valieva, which would exclude her from competition at the next Winter\\nOlympics, and to rescind her first-place performance at the previous Beijing Olympics because,\\n\"the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) did not meet a WADA-imposed Nov. 4 deadline to\\ndeliver a verdict on Valiyeva\\'s case.\"[249]\\nRussian doping scandal\\n3/6/25, 5:12 PM Olympic Games - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games#Amateurism_and_professionalism 22/48'),\n",

Shortly thereafter, the Qatar\\nOlympic Committee announced that it \"hoped to send up to four female athletes in shooting and\\nfencing\" to the 2012 Summer Games.[254]\\nIn 2008, Ali Al-Ahmed, director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, likewise called for Saudi Arabia to\\nbe barred from the Games, describing its ban on women athletes as a violation of the International\\nOlympic Committee charter. He noted: \"For the last 15 years, many international nongovernmental\\norganisations worldwide have been trying to lobby the IOC for better enforcement of its own laws\\nbanning gender discrimination.  While their efforts did result in increasing numbers of women\\nOlympians, the IOC has been reluctant to take a strong position and threaten the discriminating\\ncountries with suspension or expulsion.\"[250] In July 2010, The Independent reported: \"Pressure is\\ngrowing on the International Olympic Committee to kick out Saudi Arabia, who are likely to be the\\nonly major nation not to include women in their Olympic team for 2012. ...

Beginning in 2018, the sport of curling\\nintroduced a mixed event where teams of one man and one women competed in their own\\ntournament for a medal. As of the 2024 Paris games, there are now 13 mixed medal events across\\n11 disciplines at the summer games.[264]\\nThe world wars caused three Olympiads to pass without a celebration of the Games: the 1916\\nGames were cancelled because of World War I, and the summer and winter games of 1940 and\\n1944 were cancelled because of World War II.[45] The Russo-Georgian War between Georgia and\\nRussia erupted on the opening day of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Both American\\nPresident George W. Bush and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin were attending the\\nOlympics at that time and spoke together about the conflict at a luncheon hosted by the Chinese\\npresident Hu Jintao.[265][266]\\nTerrorism most directly affected the Olympic Games in 1972. When the Summer Games were held\\nin Munich, Germany, eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by the\\nPalestinian terrorist group Black September in what is now known as the Munich massacre. The\\nterrorists killed two of the athletes soon after taking them hostage and killed the other nine during\\na failed liberation attempt. A German police officer and five of the terrorists also died.[267]\\nFollowing the selection of Barcelona, Spain, to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, the separatist ETA\\nterrorist organisation launched attacks in the region, including the 1991 bombing in the Catalonian\\ncity of Vic that killed ten people.[268][269]\\nTerrorism affected two Olympic Games held in the United States. During the 1996 Summer\\nOlympics in Atlanta, a bomb was detonated at the Centennial Olympic Park, killing two people and\\ninjuring 111 others. The bomb was set by Eric Rudolph, an American domestic terrorist, who is\\nserving a life sentence for the bombing.[270] The 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City took place\\njust five months after the September 11 attacks, which meant a higher level of security than ever\\nbefore provided for an Olympic Games. The opening ceremonies of the Games featured symbols\\nrelating to 9/11, including the flag that flew at Ground Zero and honour guards of NYPD and FDNY\\nmembers.[271]\\nThe Olympic Charter requires that an athlete be a legal national of the country for which they\\ncompete. Dual nationals may compete for either country, as long as three years have passed since\\nthe competitor competed for the former country. However, if the NOCs and IF involved agree, then\\nthe IOC Executive Board may reduce or cancel this period.[272] This waiting period exists only for\\nWar and terrorism\\nCitizenship\\nIOC rules for citizenship\\n3/6/25, 5:12 PM Olympic Games - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games#Amateurism_and_professionalism 24/48'),\n",

If an athlete\\ngains a new or second nationality, then they do not need to wait any designated amount of time\\nbefore participating for the new or second nation. The IOC is only concerned with issues of\\ncitizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes.[273]\\nIn October 2023, the IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee, and the suspension was\\nupheld in February 2024 by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.[274] Without any NOC from Russia\\nto approve a change of citizenship in under three years from Russia to another country, the IOC\\nExecutive Board approved changes of nationality in November 2023 and March 2024 for a total of\\nfive athletes from Russia to another country, including Georgi Tiblov and Aleksandr Komarov in\\nwrestling (from Russia to Serbia), Mikhail Yakolev in cycling (from Russia to Israel), Valeriia\\nLiubimova in cycling, and Anastasiia Kirpichnikova in swimming (both from Russia to\\nFrance).[275][276][277][278]\\nOccasionally, an athlete will become a citizen of a different country to enable them to compete in\\nthe Olympics. This is often because they are attracted to sponsorship deals or training facilities in\\nthe other country, or the athlete might be unable to qualify from within their country of birth. In\\npreparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, the Russian Olympic Committee naturalised a\\nSouth Korean-born short-track speed-skater, Ahn Hyun-soo, and an American-born snowboarder,\\nVic Wild. The two athletes won five gold medals and one bronze medal between them at the 2014\\nGames.[279]\\nMedals are awarded to the athletes or teams who place first, second, and third in each event. The\\nwinners receive gold medals, which were solid gold until 1912, later made of gilded silver, and now\\ngold-plated silver. Every gold medal must contain at least six grams of pure gold.[280] The runners-\\nup are awarded silver medals and the third-place athletes receive bronze medals. In events\\ncontested by a single-elimination tournament (most notably boxing), third place might not be\\ndetermined and the losers of both semi-finals each receive a bronze medal.\\nAt the 1896 Olympics, only the winner and runner-up of each event received medals—silver for\\nfirst and bronze for second, with no gold medals awarded. The current three-medal format was\\nintroduced at the 1904 Olympics.[281] From 1948 onward, athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth\\nhave received certificates, which came to be known officially as Olympic diplomas; from 1984,\\nthese have also been awarded to the seventh- and eighth-place finishers.

They were held every four years until the 6th\\ncentury AC. The first \"modern\" Olympics took place in 1896 in\\nAthens, Greece. Athletes participate in the Olympics Games to\\nrepresent their countries.\\nOver time the Olympics have become bigger. In old times,\\nwomen were not allowed, but now there are women\\'s events.\\nThe Winter Games were created for ice and snow sports. The\\nParalympic Games were created for athletes with physical\\ndisabilities. As well, the Olympics became bigger with the\\naddition of the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes.\\nWorld War I and World War II led to the cancellation of the\\n1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. As the decision-making body, the\\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) is responsible for\\nchoosing the host city for each Olympic Games. The IOC is also\\nresponsible for choosing what sports are in the games. The creator of modern Olympics is Baron\\nPierre de Coubertin.\\nThe celebration of the Games includes many rituals and symbols, such as Olympic flag and torch,\\nas well as the opening and closing ceremonies. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each\\nevent receive, respectively, gold, silver, and bronze medals.\\n3/7/25, 10:21 AM Olympic Games - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\nhttps://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games 1/20'),\n",

During the\\nOlympic Games all struggles among the participating city-\\nstates were postponed until the games were finished.[2]\\nThe origin of these Olympics is shrouded in mystery and\\nlegend[3] According to legend, it was Heracles who first\\ncalled the Games \"Olympic\" and established the custom of\\nholding them every four years.[4] The most widely accepted\\ndate for the beginning of the Ancient Olympics is 776BC;\\nbased on inscriptions of the winners of a footrace held every four years starting then.[5] The\\nAncient Games featured running events, a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, discus and\\njavelin throws, a foot race and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, and equestrian events.[6][7]\\nThere is no agreement on when the Games officially ended, but many historians think it is 393 AD,\\nwhen the Christian Roman emperor Theodosius I declared that all Pagan religious practices should\\nend.[8] Another date might be 426 AD, when the next emperor Theodosius II ordered the\\ndestruction of all Greek temples.[9] After the Olympics stopped, they were not held again until the\\nlate 19th century.\\nAn attempt to copy the ancient Olympic Games was the\\nL\\'Olympiade de la République annually from 1796 to 1798 in\\nRevolutionary France.[10] The competition had several sports\\nfrom the ancient Greek Olympics.[10]\\nGreek interest in bringing back the Olympic Games began with\\nthe Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in\\n1821. It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor\\nPanagiotis Soutsos in his poem \"Dialogue of the Dead\",\\npublished in 1833.[11] Evangelis Zappas, a wealthy Greek-\\nRomanian philanthropist, first wrote to King Otto of Greece, in\\n1856, offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic\\nGames.[12] Zappas sponsored the first Olympic Games in 1859,\\nwhich was held in Athens. Athletes from Greece and the\\nOttoman Empire participated. Zappas funded the restoration of\\nthe ancient Panathenaic stadium so that it could host all future\\nOlympic Games.[12]\\nBetween 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. It was created by John\\nHulley and Charles Melly, with support from Dr. Brookes. These games were unfair in nature since\\nonly Men could compete.[13][14][15] In 1865 Hulley, Dr. Brookes and E.G. Ravenstein founded the\\nNational Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association. Its\\narticles of foundation provided the framework for the International Olympic Charter.[16]\\nAncient Olympics\\nThe Growth of the Olympics\\n3/7/25, 10:21 AM Olympic Games - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\nhttps://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games 2/20'),\n",

In 1866, a national Olympic Games in Great Britain was organized by Dr. Brookes at\\nLondon's Crystal Palace.[17]\\nThe Panathinaiko Stadium hosted Olympics in 1870 and 1875.[18] Thirty thousand spectators\\nattended that Games in 1870, although no official attendance records are available for the 1875\\nGames.[19] In 1890, after attending the Olympian Games of the Wenlock Olympian Society, Baron\\nPierre de Coubertin created the International Olympic Committee.[20] Coubertin built on the ideas\\nand work of Brookes and Zappas with the aim of creating an Olympic Games that would occur\\nevery four years in a different country.[20] He presented these ideas during the first meeting of the\\nnewly created International Olympic Committee (IOC). This meeting was held from June 16 to\\nJune 23, 1894, at the Sorbonne University in Paris. On the last day of the meeting, it was decided\\nthat the first Olympic Games, to be controlled by the IOC, would take place two years later in\\nAthens.[21] The IOC elected the Greek writer Demetrius Vikelas as its first president.[22]\\nThe first Games held under the IOC was hosted in the Panathenaic stadium in\\nAthens in 1896. These Games brought 14 nations and 241 athletes who\\ncompeted in 43 events.[23] Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas had left\\nthe Greek government money to fund future Olympic Games. This money was\\nused to pay for the 1896 Games.[24][25] George Averoff paid for the\\nrefurbishment of the stadium in preparation for the Games.[26] The Greek\\ngovernment also provided money, which was paid back through the sale of\\ntickets. Money was also paid back through the sale of the first Olympic\\ncommemorative stamp set.[26]\\nThe Greek officials and public were excited\\nabout hosting these Games. This feeling was shared by many of\\nthe athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the host of the\\nOlympic Games on a permanent basis. The IOC did not\\napprove this request. The IOC stated that each games would be\\nheld in a different country.[27]\\nFollowing the success of the 1896 Games, the Olympics entered\\na period of stagnation that threatened their survival. The Olympic Games held at the Paris\\nExposition in 1900 and the World's Fair at St. Louis in 1904 were side-shows. The Games at Paris\\ndid not have a stadium, however this was the first time women took part in the games. The St.\\nLouis Games hosted 650 athletes, but 580 were from the United States. The homogeneous nature\\nof these celebrations was a low point for the Olympic Movement.[28] The Games rebounded when\\nthe Intercalated Games (so-called because they were the second Games held within an Olympiad, a\\nperiod of time lasting four years) were held in Athens. These Games are not officially recognized by\\nthe IOC and no Intercalated Games have been held since. These Games were hosted at the\\nPanathenaic stadium in Athens. The games attracted an international field of participants and\\ngenerated great public interest.[29]\\n1896 Games\\nChanges and adaptations\\n3/7/25, 10:21 AM Olympic Games - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\nhttps://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games 3/20\"),\n",

This was done to make sure\\nthat Salt Lake City won. The IOC investigated and four members resigned and six people were\\nsacked.[44]\\nA BBC documentary entitled Panorama: Buying the Games, aired in August 2004, investigated\\nthe taking of bribes in the bidding process for the 2012 Summer Olympics.[45] The documentary\\nclaimed it was possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city. After\\nbeing narrowly defeated in their bid for the 2012 Summer Games,[46] Parisian Mayor Bertrand\\nDelanoë accused the British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the London Bid Committee of breaking\\nthe bid rules.[47]\\nThe Turin bid for the 2006 Winter Olympics was also shrouded in controversy. A prominent IOC\\nmember, Marc Hodler, strongly connected with the rival bid of Sion, Switzerland, alleged bribery\\nof IOC officials by members of the Turin Organizing Committee. These accusations led to a wide-\\nranging investigation. The allegations also served to sour many IOC members against Sion\\'s bid\\nand potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination.[48]\\nThe Olympic logo also known as the Olympic rings, consists of\\nfive intertwined rings and represents the unity of the five\\ninhabited continents (America, Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe).\\nThe colored version of the rings—blue, yellow, black, green,\\nand red—over a white field forms the Olympic flag. The flag\\nwas adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time at the 1920\\nSummer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium.

The mascot is either an animal or human figure\\nrepresenting the cultural heritage of the host country.[51]\\nAs mandated by the Olympic Charter, various elements frame\\nthe opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.[52][53] Most of\\nthese rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in\\nAntwerp.[54] The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of\\nthe host country's flag and a performance of its national\\nanthem.[52][53] The host nation then presents artistic displays\\nof music, singing, dance, and theater representative of its\\nculture.[54]\\nAfter the artistic portion of the ceremony, the athletes parade\\ninto the stadium grouped by nation. Greece is traditionally the\\nfirst nation to enter in order to honor the origins of the\\nOlympics. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's chosen\\nlanguage.

For example, wrestling is a Summer Olympic sport, comprising\\ntwo disciplines: Greco-Roman and Freestyle. It is broken down into fourteen events for men and\\nfour events for women. Each event represents a different weight class.[60] The Summer Olympics\\nprogram includes 26 sports, while the Winter Olympics program features 15 sports.[61]\\nOlympic sports are governed by international sports federations (IFs) recognized by the IOC as the\\nglobal supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC.[62] Changes\\ncan happen to the list of sports in the Olympics. Sports can be added or removed from the list on\\nthe basis of a two-thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC.[63]\\nThe 114th IOC meeting, in 2002, limited the Summer Games program to a maximum of 28 sports,\\n301 events, and 10,500 athletes.[64] Three years later, at the 117th IOC Session, the first major\\nchange to the list was performed. This resulted in the removal of baseball and softball from the list\\nof sports for the 2012 London Games. Since there was no agreement in the promotion of two other\\nsports, the 2012 program will feature just 26 sports.[64] The 2016 and 2020 Games will return to\\nthe maximum of 28 sports given the addition of rugby and golf.[65]\\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern\\nOlympics. The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his\\nmedals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics.\\nHis medals were restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds.[66] As class structure\\nevolved through the 20th century, the definition of the amateur athlete as an aristocratic\\ngentleman became outdated.[67] The advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of\\nthe Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-\\nfinanced amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. Nevertheless, the IOC held to the\\ntraditional rules regarding amateurism.[68]\\nMedal presentation\\nSports\\nAmateurism and professionalism\\n3/7/25, 10:21 AM Olympic Games - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\nhttps://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games 7/20'),\n",

In\\nmen\\'s football (soccer), only three professional players over the\\nage of 23 are eligible to participate per team in the Olympic\\ntournament.[69]\\nThere have been many countries deliberately\\nmissing the Olympics in order to make political\\nstatements.

The United States chose to send the pair home.[73]\\nIn the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using\\ndrugs to improve their athletic abilities. For example, the\\nwinner of the marathon at the 1904 Games, Thomas J. Hicks,\\nwas given strychnine and brandy by his coach.[74] The only\\nOlympic death linked to doping happened at the Rome Games\\nof 1960. During the cycling road race, Danish cyclist Knud\\nEnemark Jensen fell from his bicycle and later died. A\\ncoroner's inquiry found that he was under the influence of\\namphetamines.[75] By the mid-1960s, sports federations were\\nstarting to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs. The\\nIOC did likewise in 1967.[76] The IOC created the World Anti-\\nDoping Agency in 1999. The IOC-established drug testing regimen (now known as the Olympic\\nStandard) has set the worldwide benchmark that other sporting federations around the world\\nattempt to emulate.[77] The first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance-\\nenhancing drugs was Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall, a Swedish pentathlete at the 1968 Summer\\nOlympics, who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use.[78]\\nThe Olympics have not brought lasting peace to the world, even during the Games. Three Olympic\\nGames were not held due to war. The 1916 Games were cancelled because of World War I, and the\\nsummer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of World War II. Terrorism\\nhas also threatened the Olympic Games. In 1972, when the Summer Games were held in Munich,\\nWest Germany, eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by the terrorist\\ngroup Black September. This event is now known as the Munich massacre. The terrorists killed two\\nof the athletes soon after they had taken them hostage and killed the other nine during a failed\\nrescue attempt. A German police officer and 5 terrorists also died.[79] During the Summer\\nOlympics in 1996 in Atlanta, a bomb was detonated at the Centennial Olympic Park, which killed 2\\nand injured 111 others. Eric Robert Rudolph is currently serving a life sentence for the\\nbombing.[80]\\nThe host city for an Olympic Games is chosen seven years ahead of the event.[81] The process of\\nselection is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The process starts when a city\\nwanting to host the games applies to its country's Olympic group. If more than one city from the\\nsame country gives a proposal to its NOC, the national group chooses which city will run for host.\\nThe first step once the deadline passes (To tell the IOC that you want to hold the Games), is to ask\\nthe cities to complete a questionnaire which covers many key points in the organization of the\\nOlympic Games.[82] The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a group provides the IOC with\\nan idea of each cities project and their potential to host the Games.
